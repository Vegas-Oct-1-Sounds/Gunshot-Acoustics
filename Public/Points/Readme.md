This directory contains information identifying audio points of interest within a video.  Two formats are given, one for Sonic Visualiser, and one for Audacity.  Each file is a text file whose name begins with a unique pnuemonic identifying the source of the information.  The pnuemonic is followed by a short string identifying the type of information contained within the file followed by either “_aud.txt” for audacity or “.txt” for Sonic Visualiser.

This short string identifying content type is:

	“_muzzle”		    muzzle blast event
	“_sonic”		    sonic shock wave event
	“_reflection”		reflection event
	“_region”		    region of interest

Thus:
  
  The "under_muzzle.txt" file contains muzzle blast points extracted from the file "under" whose source
  is given in the map below.  The corresponding audacity file is "under_muzzle.txt.aud.txt".  At some point this
  may change to simply "under_muzzle_aud.txt".
  
All times are relative to the start of the video from which the points were extracted.

This is ongoing work, there are still gaps and errors.  I will attempt to update monthly with additions and corrections.
  
For Sonic Visualiser each file corresponds toa “time instants” layer on pane.

Source table, yet to be completely filled in, first file is a real example of the file I use most as a "static"
location recording with both good muzzle and sonic waves.

Currently there are little to no sonic measurements included in this directory.  There are also files which have not been
presented in other material/videos and will be explained at the appropriate time.
